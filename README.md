## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was a very good experience, the challenge to adjust the font size without depending on Media Queries into the CSS, was something that put my mind on investigate mode.

This was part of the solution for a class:

```html
<h1 class="card-title">HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
```

```css
.card-title {
  height: auto;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: clamp(20px, 2vw, var(--font-preset-1-size));
  font-weight: var(--font-preset-weight-bold);
  transition: color 0.2s;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn a lot more about CSS and all the frontend!

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - All about CSS, HTML and Javascript in one place, kind of technical sometimes but a great source of information.
